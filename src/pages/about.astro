                        I am a dedicated student at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a dual focus in Computer Science and History. My journey is defined by a passion for bridging the gap between technical innovation and public service. As a developer, I love building intuitive, efficient systems that solve real-world problems. As a historian, I value the context and narratives that shape our society. This unique combination allows me to approach challenges with both analytical rigor and a deep appreciation for the human element.

                        Currently, I serve as a Representative-at-Large and Historian for the CU Student Government (CUSG). In this role, I champion initiatives that improve campus life and sustainability. My recent work includes authoring and passing the "Resolution in Support of Recycling Initiatives," which mandates bin parity across campus to ensure equal access to recycling and waste disposal. I believe in proactive leadership—whether it's writing code or writing policy—and I am committed to leaving a positive, lasting impact on my community.
